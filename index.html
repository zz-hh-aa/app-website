            <div class="accordion_content">
                <p><strong>I currently work for a built environment non-profit, and before that I worked in music.</strong> Originally, I did a BA in fine art and art history. 
                    It might seem like an odd trajectory, but there's a lot of interesting art out there to do with digital tech and the internet, and that's first what got me interested in the field.</p>
                <p>Music is still a big part of my life, but working in it wasn’t for me! It’s still something I enjoy outside of work, along with reading speculative fiction, 
                    growing things / volunteering on an agro-ecological farm, and learning about degrowth and sustainability.</p>
                <p>My pronouns are they / them.</p>

        <!--accordion 2--why code-->
        <div class ="accordion">
            <button type="button" class="accordion_button">Why web development?</button>
            <div class="accordion_content">
                <p><strong>I’ve worked in the non-profit tech sector for a few years and while I love the field, I've always been frustrated that I can't build things myself.</strong> I've mostly done content and marketing
                    (which I also can’t say is something I’m hugely passionate about), but I feel like career progression isn't possible without technical skills. While I’m fairly new to it, code is exciting; there’s so much more you can 
                    do with it and so many places you can go.</p>
                <p>I feel like I have a decent grasp of certain technical concepts (from decentralisation to APIs), and while I've followed ethical tech projects and learned a bit about how they worked conceptually, 
                    I could never get my hands dirty and contribute. Projects I'm thinking of here include the (now-defunct) co-op broadcaster db, alternative social media platforms <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/" target="new">scuttlebutt</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/" target="new">are.na</a>, 
                    and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/" target="new">low-tech</a> websites, I  could never get my hands dirty and get involved or contribute.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, since tech is the main way many of us interface with the outside world, I think it’s one of those skills that everyone should have! I think basic literacy in the 
                    things we use every day is important.</p>
                <p>The non-profit, social enterprise tech sector is someting I'm passionate about. Outside of work, I’ve been involved in various mutual aid, organising, or volunteering projects 
                    and it’s been a long-time dream of mine to build or contribute to tools for social movements. (One idea I’ve had in my head for ages is a ‘gender atlas’ type thing, inspired by the <a href="https://atlasofownership.org/" target="new">Atlas of Ownership</a> I got to contribute to through work.)</p>
                <p>Long story short, building stuff is exciting and I want to be able to do it!</p>

        <!--accordion 3--why fac-->
        <div class ="accordion">
            <button type="button" class="accordion_button">Why FAC?</button>
            <div class="accordion_content">
                <p><strong>FAC’s values-led approach really resonates with me, and it's the only socially-minded bootcamp I've been able to find.</strong> Because of shared values, I think I’d be a good fit in the course culture. 
                    Beyond that, as a gender non-conforming person, I feel that it would be the most inclusive and welcoming place for me to learn. </p>
